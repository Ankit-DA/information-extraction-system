# Information Extraction System
A software solution to extract structured information from résumés using conditional random fields. This project was created for the CS3072 Final Year Project module at Brunel University London in the academic year 2016 - 2017.

The project consisted of two stages namely the data annotation and entity extraction stages.

## Data Annotation
This stage transformed raw résumés and XML files which contained labels into a format which could be used to train a classifier.
